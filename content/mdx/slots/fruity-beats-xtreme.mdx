## Comparison with Similar Games

Fruity Beats Xtreme combines elements of classic fruit slots with modern neon design and the expanding wild feature. CasinoTsu has compared it with similar games to help you choose.

Market Positioning: With a maximum payout multiplier of x606, it's modest compared to recent high-volatility, high-multiplier slots. However, its very high RTP of 98.08% makes it suitable for players who prefer stable gameplay or those looking to meet bonus wagering requirements.

Comparison with Competitors:

Classic Fruit Slots: Among the numerous fruit-themed slots released by various providers, Fruity Beats Xtreme differentiates itself with its neon design and expanding wild feature. Compared to popular classic slots like NetEnt's "Starburst," it has less feature complexity but possesses a unique charm with its high RTP and impactful expanding wilds.

High RTP Slots: Other slots with RTPs exceeding 99%, such as "Mega Joker" (NetEnt) or "Ugga Bugga" (Playtech), often have classic reel structures or unique gameplay. Fruity Beats Xtreme achieves a high RTP while maintaining a more modern video slot interface.

## Strategy and Tactics

Fruity Beats Xtreme has a relatively simple gameplay, but by focusing on the following points, you can play more strategically. CasinoTsu recommends responsible play.

Bet Amount Setting: Due to its very high RTP, it is advantageous in the long run, but as a medium volatility slot, significant temporary losses are possible. Set your bet amount within your budget and avoid overspending. When using the autoplay feature, carefully decide the bet amount per spin and set a loss limit.

Leveraging Expanding Wilds: Expanding wilds are key to achieving big wins in this slot. When the wild symbol expands to cover an entire reel, the probability of payouts across multiple paylines increases. A scenario where the entire reel is filled with wilds can lead to wins close to the maximum payout.

Ideal for Bonus Wagering: The high RTP and frequent small wins make it suitable for clearing casino bonuses (especially wagering requirements). However, without free spins or multipliers, it's different from slots that aim for explosive wins during bonus rounds.

"Spin & Play" Mindset: This slot is designed to emphasize enjoyment of the game rather than complex strategy. It's best to enjoy the original pleasure of classic slots: "just spin and wait for wins from expanding wilds."
